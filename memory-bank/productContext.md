# Product Context: Home Assistant Sensor Data Export

## Purpose

The Home Assistant Sensor Data Export tool addresses the need for users to extract, analyze, and visualize historical sensor data from their Home Assistant installations. While Home Assistant provides built-in visualization tools, users often need to:

1. Perform custom analysis using external tools
2. Create custom visualizations beyond what Home Assistant offers
3. Integrate sensor data with other datasets
4. Archive historical data for long-term storage and analysis

## User Problems Solved

1. **Data Accessibility**: Home Assistant stores historical data, but accessing it programmatically can be challenging for users without development experience.

2. **Format Flexibility**: Users need data in various formats (CSV, JSON) to work with different analysis tools.

3. **Automation Potential**: The command-line interface enables integration with automated workflows and scheduled exports.

4. **Security Concerns**: By using a secrets file and proper .gitignore configuration, users can safely version control their scripts without exposing credentials.

## Workflow

1. User sets up Home Assistant API access by creating a Long-Lived Access Token
2. User configures the secrets.py file with their Home Assistant URL and token
3. User runs the script with parameters specifying:
   - Which sensor to export data from
   - How far back in time to retrieve data
   - Where to save the exported data
4. The script connects to Home Assistant, retrieves the data, and saves it in the specified format
5. User can then import the data into their analysis tool of choice

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**: The tool should be straightforward to use, even for users with limited programming experience.

2. **Reliability**: The tool should handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback.

3. **Flexibility**: Support for different output formats and time ranges allows users to tailor the export to their needs.

4. **Transparency**: Clear feedback during execution helps users understand what's happening and diagnose any issues.

5. **Security**: Sensitive information is kept separate from the main code and excluded from version control.

## Target Users

1. **Home Assistant Enthusiasts**: Users who want to do more with their sensor data than what's possible within Home Assistant.

2. **Data Analysts**: People who want to apply advanced analytics to their home data.

3. **Automation Engineers**: Users who want to incorporate Home Assistant data into larger automated workflows.

4. **Developers**: Those building custom applications that need to incorporate historical Home Assistant data.
