# Active Context: Home Assistant Sensor Data Export

## Current Work Focus

The initial implementation of the Home Assistant Sensor Data Export tool is complete. The focus has been on creating a functional, well-documented utility that meets all the core requirements specified in the project brief.

## Recent Changes

1. **Initial Project Setup**
   - Created virtual environment for Python dependency management
   - Set up .gitignore to exclude sensitive information
   - Established project structure with documentation

2. **Core Functionality Implementation**
   - Implemented Home Assistant API client for authentication and data retrieval
   - Created command-line interface with argument parsing
   - Developed data processing and export functionality
   - Added support for multiple output formats (CSV, JSON, Excel)

3. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive README with usage instructions
   - Developed detailed API key setup documentation
   - Established memory bank for project context and documentation

4. **Dependency Management Improvements**
   - Added fallback implementation for environments without pandas
   - Pinned specific versions of numpy and pandas for compatibility
   - Enhanced error handling for missing dependencies

5. **Error Handling and Logging Enhancements**
   - Added detailed logging for API responses
   - Improved error handling for timestamp parsing
   - Added fallback mechanisms for missing fields
   - Enhanced debugging output for troubleshooting

## Current Status

The project is in a functional state with all core requirements implemented:

- ✅ Authentication with Home Assistant via Long-Lived Access Token
- ✅ Data extraction for specified sensor and time range
- ✅ Multiple output formats (CSV, JSON, Excel)
- ✅ Command-line interface with parameter validation
- ✅ Secure credential management
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test with actual Home Assistant instance
   - Validate data accuracy and format
   - Test error handling and edge cases

2. **Potential Enhancements**
   - Add support for multiple sensors in a single export
   - Implement data aggregation options (hourly, daily averages)
   - Add visualization capabilities
   - Create a configuration file for default settings

3. **Deployment and Distribution**
   - Package the tool for easier installation
   - Create example scripts for common use cases
   - Consider publishing to PyPI

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **API Approach**
   - Currently using the REST API for simplicity
   - May consider WebSocket API for real-time data in future versions

2. **Data Processing**
   - Using pandas for data manipulation and export
   - Considering more efficient approaches for very large datasets

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implemented basic error handling for common scenarios
   - May need to enhance for specific Home Assistant error responses

4. **Output Formats**
   - Currently supporting CSV, JSON, and Excel
   - Considering additional formats based on user feedback

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Current implementation prioritizes clarity and correctness
   - Future versions may optimize for performance with large datasets

## Open Questions

1. How should the tool handle rate limiting from the Home Assistant API?
2. What additional output formats would be most valuable to users?
3. Should the tool support authentication methods beyond Long-Lived Access Tokens?
4. How can we make the tool more accessible to users with limited technical experience?
