# Progress: Home Assistant Sensor Data Export

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Command-line interface with argument parsing
- ✅ Home Assistant API client implementation
- ✅ Authentication with Long-Lived Access Token
- ✅ Historical data retrieval for specified sensor
- ✅ Configurable time range in hours
- ✅ Data processing and formatting
- ✅ Multiple output formats (CSV, JSON, Excel)
- ✅ Error handling and validation
- ✅ Fallback implementation for environments without pandas
- ✅ Enhanced logging and debugging output
- ✅ Robust timestamp parsing with fallbacks
- ✅ Configurable debug mode for controlling log verbosity

### Project Structure
- ✅ Virtual environment setup
- ✅ Dependency management with requirements.txt
- ✅ Secure credential handling with secrets.py
- ✅ .gitignore configuration for security
- ✅ Project documentation

### Documentation
- ✅ README with installation and usage instructions
- ✅ API key setup documentation
- ✅ Memory bank for project context
- ✅ Code comments and docstrings

## What's Left to Build

### Testing and Validation
- ⬜ Comprehensive testing with actual Home Assistant instance
- ⬜ Edge case testing (network errors, API limitations)
- ⬜ Performance testing with large datasets

### Enhancements
- ⬜ Support for multiple sensors in a single export
- ⬜ Data aggregation options (hourly, daily averages)
- ⬜ Visualization capabilities
- ⬜ Configuration file for default settings
- ⬜ Interactive mode for easier usage

### Deployment
- ⬜ Package for PyPI distribution
- ⬜ Example scripts for common use cases
- ⬜ CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and releases

## Current Status

The project is in a functional state with all core requirements implemented. The script can:

1. Connect to a Home Assistant instance using a Long-Lived Access Token
2. Retrieve historical data for a specified sensor and time range
3. Save the data in various formats (CSV, JSON, Excel)

The implementation prioritizes clarity, correctness, and security. The code is well-documented with comments and type hints, and the project includes comprehensive documentation for setup and usage.

## Known Issues

1. **Untested with Actual Home Assistant Instance**
   - The script has been developed based on the Home Assistant API documentation but has not been tested with an actual instance.
   - May require adjustments based on real-world testing.

2. **Limited Error Handling for API-Specific Errors**
   - While basic error handling is implemented, specific Home Assistant API error responses may not be handled optimally.
   - Additional error handling may be needed based on testing.

3. **Performance with Large Datasets**
   - The current implementation loads all data into memory, which may be inefficient for very large datasets.
   - Future versions may need to implement streaming or chunking for better performance.

4. **Limited Output Customization**
   - The current implementation provides basic output formatting based on file extension.
   - More customization options may be needed for specific use cases.

## Next Milestone

The next milestone is to test the script with an actual Home Assistant instance using the test sensor (`sensor.fabic_care_025_energy_power`) and validate the data retrieval and export functionality.

## Success Metrics

The project will be considered successful when:

1. It can reliably connect to a Home Assistant instance and authenticate
2. It can accurately retrieve historical data for the specified sensor and time range
3. It can correctly format and save the data in the specified output format
4. It handles errors gracefully with informative messages
5. Users can easily set up and use the tool with minimal technical knowledge
